# C# - Structs, Enumerations

## [0. They're good dogs](./0-dog/0-dog.cs)
Define a new enum `Rating` with the values `Good`, `Great`, `Excellent`.

## [1. Chief Puppy Officer](./1-dog/1-dog.cs)
Based on `0-dog`, define a new struct `Dog` with the following members:
- `name`, type: `public string`
- `age`, type: `public float`
- `owner`, type: `public string`
- `rating`, type: `public Rating`

## [2. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself](./2-dog/2-dog.cs)
Based on `1-dog`, add a constructor to struct `Dog` that takes parameters.

## [3. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad](./3-dog/3-dog.cs)
Based on `2-dog`, override the `.ToString()` method to print the Dog object’s attributes to stdout.

Format:
```
Dog Name: <name>
Age: <age>
Owner: <owner>
Rating: <rating>
```
