- private field `name`
- `name` should be a string and have a default value of `(No name)`
- public property `Name`
	- `get`: retrieve name
	- `set`: set name
- public method `public int GetHealth()` that returns the value of health of the Zombie object

## [5. Printing a zombie](./5-enemy/5-enemy.cs)
Based on `4-enemy`, write a public class `Zombie` that defines a zombie by:
- private field `health`
